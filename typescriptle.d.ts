// The split type is used to turn a word, both a guess and our solution, into an array of characters.
// This is done via template literal types. These are types which allow us to match on the pattern of a
// string and extract parts from it. Below we can see that we split our string `T` by `Delimiter`, which by
// default is an empty string. Using an empty string will effectively split a string into all its individual characters.
// The `infer` keyword is used to tell TypeScript to figure out what the type at the given position is. In our case
// it means that TypeScript will extract our characters.
type Split<T extends string, Delimiter extends string = ""> =
  // If a string has characters both before and after the delimiter
  // we extract the parts around the delimiter, add the part in front of it
  // to our list of strings and then recursively call the Split type again with the
  // the rest of our string. The result of this we spread into the array we're returning.
  // This works just like array spreading in JavaScript.

// The join type is the opposite of our above split type. In this case we are not allowing for a delimiter
// to be added back in. We are simply concatenating all elements in `T` back together.
// `...infer Tail` is the equivalent of JavaScript's `rest` operator (`...`).
// The below type checks if our input `T` is a list which has 1 or more items and if so,
// extract the first item, place it into a template string and then recursively call `Join` again
// with the rest of the list. Once we have extracted all our elements from the list, we have an empty
// list and will return an empty string, terminating the recursion.
// The helper functions `CastToString` and `CastToStringList` are used because TypeScript does not know that
// `Head` and `Tail` are actually of type `string` and `string[]` respectively, even though `T` has to be a `string[]`.
// Instead of casting it would also be fine to add two additional `extend` checks, one for `Head` and one for `Tail`.
// This would increase the ternary nesting though and since we can be certain that these are strings, casting is
// the easier option.
